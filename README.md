### Asteroids
This project chose me! Asteroids is a computer game where the user plays a spaceship and avoids asteroid-like figures using the keyboard arrows. My version of Asteroids was developed in JGRASP using java. There are many classes within the project that when run together, create the game. The logic of the game is mostly in the Asteroids and Game file. 

As I worked on this project in an introductory class, it taught me a lot about method calls, class objects, variable declarations, etc. With that being said, this project helped me understand the concepts and techniques of object-oriented software design, which is one of our CS learning goals.


### Floppy Fish
Floppy Fish is a super cool spelling game made in Unity using C. My group chose this project because most of us had never used Unity and we were directed to develop a game related to either math or spelling. The game consists of two modes, explore and arcade. The explore mode leads the user through mazes where they collect a coin if they can spell a word correctly. The arcade mode has a moving background and obstacles for the user to avoid using the space button to jump. Again, the user collects coins by running into them and spelling a word correctly.

This project gave me experience working in a group setting where each member had to collaborate with one another in order to achieve our game product. Since Unity was a new technology for most team members, it was a big learning curve and took a lot of problem solving to overcome obstacles. In this project, our team accomplished many Westminster college-wide learning goals. We combined our creativity and ideas to create an original game. We demonstrated critical thinking when exploring different directions to take our game as well as different solutions to issues that would arise.


### Keepsake
Keepsake, a solo project, is a database made using MySQL with project code written in python and SQL. The database uses a console (text-based) application that interacts with multiple different users of the Deaf community. The purpose of this database is to store category and text information of the userâ€™s choice.

Working on Keepsake gave me hands on experience working on a project independently. I now better understand storage within a computer system from a back-end perspective. There were also many bugs working with the database that I had to use problem solving skills to overcome. When acquiring data from users, you have to be very careful about what information you are gathering and who can see that information. This project satisfies the college-wide global responsibility goal since it is a safe and secure database.


### IN TOUCH
IN TOUCH is a communicative Android application that aims to assist those who are deaf or hard of hearing with daily interactions. I chose to do my CAPSTONE on this project because it seemed fun to work on, achievable, and it's purpose is to help people. The application takes in audio or text input and displays it largely on the screen for fluid conversation. The methods used to achieve this user-friendly application include: a simple design framework, speech-to-text and text-to-speech APIs, an interactive database, and visible front-end features of the application.

This project helped me achieve many college-wide and CS specific learning goals.



### Chatroom Protocol


### Slope Perception Survey Website


I demonstrated each of the college-wide learning goals while working on this project. Our team consisted of two web designers and four web developers. It took both collaboration and communication to succeed as a team and develop a successful product.
